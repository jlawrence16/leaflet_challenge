In this project, I was taksed with developing a visualization using United States Geological Survey data on earthquakes.

Using Leaflet, I produced a map containing markers showing the location of all earthquakes over magnitube 2.5 from the last seven days.

I customised the markers to appear as circles whose radius corresponds to the magnitude of the earthquake. The cirlce color was changed to correspond to the depth at which the earthquake occured.

I added tool tips which gives the location, magnitude and depth of each earthquake.

I also added a legend to the map.
